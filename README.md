## Personal Projects vs Vibe Code

Utility scripts etc I often vibe code. These include small scripts that I have ideas for, that aid my workflow for a greater purpose. I wouldn't call them projects, they're more or less "this will be helpful" type scripts.
Examples include:
- network daemon checker
- firewall daemon checker

Personal projects such as the file upload auditor, I don't vibe code, they're my 'pet projects'.
